At TEC, our consultants deliver tailored financial and economic appraisals and business cases for infrastructure as well as public service initiatives ranging from transport, health or community services.

## Financial & Economic Appraisal

Financial & economic appraisal is essential in determining costs incurred and benefits that arise from project investments in order to justify and prioritise these investments. Appraisal is an essential element of planning for new investments and is a required for major government infrastructure and large public service initiatives. The process involves analysing present and future flows of costs and benefits brought back to present values to enable comparative analysis.

Key appraisal measures that TEC can help both governments and non-government players include;

* Cost-benefit analysis - provides a cost-benefit ratio, net-present value, internal rate of return.
* Cost-effectiveness analysis – common in estimating social investment benefits such as health and helps in prioritising social investments where quantifying outcomes is not easily measurable.
* Financial return analysis – common in commercial analysis of returns to investments.
* Feasibility studies – common to establish preliminary qualitative feasibility and merits of proposed investments.
